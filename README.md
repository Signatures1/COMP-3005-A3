Description: 
    COMP-3005 Assigment 3, what I'm doing here is creating a databse adding a students tabel
    <br>
    filling it out with information, then running various functions(get all students, add student, edit
    <br> 
    feature, delete student) and then connecting it to a python file on VSCode and running the functions in 
    <br>
    main.py and putting in a demonstration video.
<br>
<br>
SETUP:
    <br>
    1. In terminal run:
        <br>
        pip install psycopg2-binary
        <br>
        pip install python-dotenv
        <br>
        (Everything from requirments.txt)
        <br>
    2. In app folder, create a (.env) file and fill it with your databse info:
    <br>
        PGHOST=
        <br>
        PGPORT=
        <br>
        PGUSER=
        <br>
        PGPASSWORD=
        <br>
        PGDATABASE=
        <br>
        (IN THE FORMAT ABOVE)
        <br>
    3. Go to db folder and copy&paste db.sql into database and save it
    <br>
    4. RUN main.py
    <br>
